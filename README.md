In this project, I developed a website using Google API, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and the JSON format. I created a page where users can search for a location with an autocomplete feature. Once a location is selected, the page displays relevant images, a map of the place, and additional information. This project was part of an internship, and it was an exciting challenge to work on.
